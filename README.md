## FAQs

### 1. Can I use these Capstone projects in my job interviews?

Yes! That's the purpose of these capstone projects. Unlike course projects with solution code and walkthroughs, Capstone Projects are entirely your own work. Over a million students have enrolled in this web development course worldwide. Adding a course project to your portfolio might reveal its origin. However, Capstone Projects, with no solution code or design specs, are purely your creation. They can be considered your own work and included in your portfolio.

When hiring developers, portfolios showcasing personal projects are often more important than university degrees or certifications. Many CEOs of multinational companies and startups share this perspective.

### 2. What if I don’t remember how to do something?

Watching a video is often not enough to master a skill. Capstone Projects provide an excellent opportunity to identify and address your weak points. If you find yourself stuck or forgetting how to do something, review previous lessons or online documentation to bridge your knowledge gaps.
